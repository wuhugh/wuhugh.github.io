    Hello! I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the University of Florida.
    I love playing games of all kinds, biking, and building stuff. I've been programming for about
    three years now, starting with the beloved Hello, World to this website and beyond.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feel free to look around the page, send me a message, or break the site.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also if you know who owns the domain hughwu.com, tell them I am open to buying that name.
    My current offer is 3 (three) FlexBucks but we can also barter.
